## FP12 ##

This is a BASIC program to generate a file of footprints suitable for inclusion in BCP design files.  (Each design file contains its own copy of just the
footprints used in that design.)  Footprints are generated from DATA statements in the program.



## WL2DES ##

This is a program which takes a wiring list  (either from a separate file or from DATA statements within the program)  and a footprints file, and generates
a BCP design file with space for routed tracks.

## DGM ##

This is a version of the Database, Graphics and Maths library code, used by WL2DES.  If replaced, you must update the entry points in the program.
