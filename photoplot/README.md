The Photoplot disc contains a program to generate photoplot and drill files suitable for PCB manufacture, from a BCP design database.

The machine code files `TRICODE` and `MNUCODE` are generated from sources which can be found in the [beebasm](https://github.com/JulieMontoya/BCP_design/tree/master/beebasm) folder; see  [photoplot_main.6502](https://github.com/JulieMontoya/BCP_design/blob/master/photoplot/photoplot_main.6502)  reproduced above.

This is the BASIC wrapper for the photoplot generation program.
