\  BCP DESIGN -- SIDEWAYS RAM VERSION
\
\  R.BCP_SW     => SELF-COPYING ROM IMAGE
\
\  FOR MODEL B: */R.BCP_SW
\  FOR MASTER: *SRLOAD R.BCP_SW 8000 4
\
\  NOW A "PROPER" SIDEWAYS ROM IMAGE, PROVIDING *COMMANDS:
\
\    *BCP <hex_addr>    Call a routine in BCP sideways ROM
\                       Sets up registers from A%, X%, Y%
\                       Returns value in U% like USR
\
\    *PARSE             Call real_parse_cmd
\
\  No longer requires a "stub" in main RAM.
