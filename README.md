BCP: a BBC Micro Printed Circuit Design Program

A program to design printed circuit boards on the BBC Micro.  Yes, really.  Currently still just about fits into a Model B.  Whether or not it will still fit when finished  (if it ever gets finished)  is, at this stage, anybody's guess.

The brief: Accept input in the form of a wiring list (schematic capture can wait .....) and turn this, and user input, into Gerber and Drill files that can be used for manufacturing.  There is also, of course, a canonical format for wiring lists: the SPICE deck. We simply append an extra field to the end of each line, delimited by a star -- which the SPICE interpreter treats as a comment marker, so it does not even spoil the validity of the file! -- to indicate the (initial) footprint for the component.

Done so far: The graphics library and most of the database. Drawing selected parts (silkscreen, boundary, topside pad, underside pad) of selected footprints. Read wiring list and seed database tables. Place parts on screen, store and retrieve positions, draw relevant layers. Report generation (not just human-readable reports such as parts list; Gerber and drill files are also reports by definition) can be done in BASIC; most of necessary code already written as part of test suite, just needs collating together.

Footprints currently generated by a separate BASIC program which is currently also the test suite for the graphics library.

Wiring table currently generated by a separate BASIC program which is currently also the test suite for the database library, and from embedded DATA statements aot from a modified SPICE deck.

Currently working on: Drawing traces.

The name really stands for "Back of Cigarette Packet", and it's pure coincidence that this also spells PCB backwards and is short for "BBC Circuit Program". :D
