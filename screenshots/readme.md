Screenshots from various stages of work in progress.
* bcp001.png : Early stage, showing a component footprint being built up on screen using BASIC to call a series of PROCs.
* bcp002,png : Test of placement on screen.  This is still expecting footprints to be selected numerically .....
* bcp36_assembling.png : In which Jules talks super dirty  :)  Look what I did at &512A.
* bcp_mode1_640.png : In which, just for S&G, we try it in MODE 1 on a Master 128.  This looked so good, I made it double size  :)
* bcp_38_search_node.png : In which we try out how to create rats-nest lines, using BASIC to call machine code routines directly with USR and also PROCs.  Back to MODE 5 on a Model B, because we do want it to run on this target if at all possible.
* bcp_put25_preview.png : In which we get to make connections at last! Although there is still no way of saving your creations yet .....
