Files for the new BeebAsm build system.

BCP is now a BeebAsm project, although it is still intended to maintain a native BBC-compatible build process as a secondary objective.  (Otherwise, it's not
really a BBC project at all, but a PC project with a specialised toolchain and runtime.)

## bbcpcb110_nocode.ssd ##
This disc image file contains the BASIC loader, but none of the files generated by BeebAsm, so it can have the output files added directly to it.

```
$ nano bcp_main.6502 #    comment where indicated
$ beebasm -i bcp_main.6502 -v > bcp_main.log
$ nano bcp_main.6502 #    uncomment where indicated
$ gather_vars -m L.A16VARS -l bcp_main.log -O bcp_main.vars bcp_main.6502
$ beebasm -i bcp_main.6502 -di bbcpcb110_nocode.ssd -do bbcpcb110.ssd
```
