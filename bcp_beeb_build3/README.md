# BCP Beeb Build 3 #

This version is designed to be built entirely in the target environment.

It builds successfully on an emulated Master 128, but the build process runs out of memory on a 32K Model B.  This might be as simple to solve as exporting
fewer variables, or could involve splitting chunks further.  _Set `o%=O%:p%=P%` in `PROCev` and begin next chunk with `O%=o%:P%=p%` to continue assembling_
_after code already assembled._

**TO BUILD IT**
```
S%=TRUE
CHAIN"VDUMP25"
```
(or just use the `VDUMP` out of the .ssd file.)  Note, if `S%=FALSE` then **the code must be saved by hand!**
```
CHAIN "WKS02SC"
```
Answer N to "paged mode", Y to "show code" and watch the build process.

The build takes two passes  (of which one is actually a double pass, so maybe it takes three passes).
1.  Each section -- `WKS02SC`, `MTH11SC`, `DBM57SC`, `GFX50SC` and `DES17SC` -- uses a `*EXEC` command to import any variables from the previous program
as a series of immediate-mode BASIC commands, so they take up no additional space in memory beyond the variable name, its contents and some sundry
housekeeping data; then assembles its code above HIMEM with OPT 4.  At the end of this pass, all labels defined in the code are properly assigned to
BASIC variables.  The program then invokes a utility to dump out as a `*SPOOL` file, the definitions of all variables except the static integer variables
`A%`-`Z%` and `@%`, and any variables whose names begin with an `_` underscore or `Â£` pound sign; and finally, chain-loads the next program.  The effect
of this is for variables to persist from one BASIC program to another.
2.  By the end of pass one, we have gathered up all labels in the code not starting with an underscore or pound sign  (these can be used to indicate
labels not referenced outside this section of code, such as destinations of conditional branches which only matter within the loop to which they belong,
so only important entry points need get exported).  We now work through `MTH11SC`, `DBM57SC`, `GFX50SC` and `DES17SC` again  (`WKS02SC` is just a series
of BASIC variable initialisations and assembler label definitions, and already saved its output the first time); running one assembler pass with OPT 4
to gather up the labels we did not export, and a second with OPT 6 or OPT 7 actually to assemble the code above HIMEM, but using addresses appropriate to
its intended location in memory.  Lastly, each section saves its assembled code, with the appropriate reload address and an execution address pointing to
some convenient RTS instruction, and chain-loads the next one.
3.  After all the code has been assembled, `FINALE` is run.  This reads the final list of exported variables, and dumps out a minimal selection of
them to enable the test program `DT42G` to be run.  It then concatenates together the individual machine code sections as `ALLCODE`.

You can edit `FINALE` to `*DELETE` the individual machine code files before saving ALLCODE and this will be saved in the space where they were.

**TO RUN IT**
You will need a disc in drive 1 with `D.JSI0` and any other design file you wish to load.
```
*DRIVE 1
*LOAD :0.M.PAGEA
CHAIN ":0.DT42G"
```
(You should only need to load PAGEA once per session unless something goes very badly wrong and/or you reset the machine.)
You can draw saved routes by crashing out of the program, setting `A%=0` and pressing `f3`.  Press `f2` to increase `A%`, then `f3` again .....


Focus will now shift fully to development under BeebAsm, since the concept of a native build has been proven.
